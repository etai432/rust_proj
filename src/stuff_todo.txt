Stuff I should do with rust:
9. later - unsafe and async rust books
10. later .csv/image manipulation crate
json
rust iter functions

impossible ass projects:
writing a simple raytracer - done for now, can get better
build a neural netowrk
Create a scripting language using Rust
build a simple kernel
